        <h3> Dr. Andrew Charman </h3>
      
        <p>Andrew Charman, PhD, is a Director of the Sustainable Livelihoods Foundation, a specialist research, advisory and policy engagement organisation. He trained as a sociologist and development economist, studying at the University of Cape Town and Cambridge University. Andrew has worked across the Southern African region on addressing development challenges in a broad range of contexts, both rural and urban. His current work focuses on influencing public policy towards the township economy and informal micro-enterprises. This work seeks to shift government policy away from the emphasis on controlling micro-enterprises/restricting activities towards a more enabling policy framework to foster formalisation through promoting development strategies that build upon organic growth and utilise local resources and human capabilities. A central aspect of this agenda is to argue for the reduction in regulatory barriers and the need to address structural impediments, notably land for commercial activities.</p>

<p>In seeking to better understand the informal economy, Andrew has used a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods, including methods to enhance stakeholder participation (participatory visual methods and action research), social-spatial analysis of the business environment and architecture, a path-breaking small area business census approach, and the use of mappings and diagrams. Under his direction, the Foundation has overseen a process of policy engagement using exhibition events which have been conducted in a number of townships. The exhibition approach has sought to facilitate an interaction amongst stakeholders (policy shapers, politicians, academics and informal economy actors) through visual knowledge and experiential learning. Andrew has published research on a range of topics relating to the township economy in South Africa, including competition in the grocery retail sector, the economics and politics of liquor trading, enterprise change in space and time, and street trader dynamics.</p>
