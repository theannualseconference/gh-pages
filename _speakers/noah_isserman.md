Noah is currently Assistant Professor of Business Administration and Social Work (visiting) at the University of Illinois, where he co-founded and directs the university wide Social Innovation at Illinois initiative and the award-winning iVenture Accelerator. He also serves on the four person core team tasked with design and rollout of the upcoming $48m Design Center.

Noah has worked with dozens of organizations on strategy, sustainability, process, and messaging, generally at the board level. This work, undertaken both independently and as a consultant with Washington, DC-based Common Ground Consulting, has taken place on six continents.

As an entrepreneur and CEO, Noah has helped build and sell two profitable enterprises, WholeData LLC (acquired by the Upjohn Institute) and MAStorage, Inc, both of which deliberately generated social as well as commercial value. He supports entrepreneurship from several advisory boards and expert groups, including the Council of LAUNCH, an initiative of USAID, Nike, the US State Department, and the NSA.

He has designed and delivered courses at the University of Cambridge and Illinois at the undergraduate, MBA, MSt, and MTech levels.

He holds degrees from Amherst and Cambridge.
