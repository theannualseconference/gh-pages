Professor Tyler Wry studies the formation, functioning, and social impact of hybrid ventures, with a particular focus on social enterprises. Taking a broad, cross-national view, this work considers how forces in the external environment affect the ability of social enterprises to acquire resources, balance intensive outreach with financial sustainability, and positively affect society. Tyler's work has been published in outlets such as the Academy of Management Annals, the Academy of Management Journal, the Academy of Management Review, the Journal of Business Venturing, and Organization Science. In his spare time, Tyler is a tired dad who enjoys running, racquet sports, and fleeting moments of quiet.
